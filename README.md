# hello-world
Very first repository
Hello class,

My name is Stephanie Alvarez. I love coffee preferably iced and black. 
This class is a little intimidating, like the very first time you saw a standard deviation equation 
and you were questioning math in general, that is how I'm feeling about this web concentrated class. 
I have not dropped or failed a class yet so here we go.
